<h1>
    You don't have to understand Life's nature,<br>
    then it becomes a grand affair.
</h1>

<h2>
  Let every day just of itself occur<br>
  like a child walks away from every hurt<br>
  and happens upon the gift of many flowers.<br>
</h2>

<h3>
  To collect and the blossoms spare,<br>
  that never enters the child's mind. <br>
</h3>

<h4>
  She gently unties them from her hair,<br>
  where they were kept captive with such delight,<br>
  and the hands of the loving, youthful years<br>
</h4>

<h5>
   and the hands of the loving, youthful years<br>
   reach out to embrace the new.<br> 
</h5>
