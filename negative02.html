<p>
    You don't have to understand Life's nature,<br>
    then it becomes a grand affair.<br><br>



  Let every day just of itself occur<br>
  like a child walks away from every hurt<br>
  and happens upon the gift of many flowers.<br><br>



  To collect and the blossoms spare,<br>
  that never enters the child's mind. <br><br>



  She gently unties them from her hair,<br>
  where they were kept captive with such delight,<br>
  and the hands of the loving, youthful years<br>



   reach out to embrace the new.<br> 




 <br>
  -Rainer Maria Rilke (1898)-<br>
